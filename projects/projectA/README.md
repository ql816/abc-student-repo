## Description
This project is aimed at simulating a telegraph machine. <br>
By pressing the telegraph machine, you can output dot or dash to the screen. By following the rule of the Morse Code, the machine will transform the dots and dashes you inputted into characters. <br>
There will be a time indicator on the page. To input, a dash, press the telegraph machine until the time turns 800. To input, a dot, press the telegraph machine and release it before the time turns 800. <br>
I hope you enjoy the project!

## Difficulties encountered
The most significant difficulty I met with is to determine the time the telegraph machine is pressed. I finally worked it out by setting an interval that continuously inquiries to see how long the telegraph machine is pressed.
