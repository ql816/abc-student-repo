# Coding Foundation
## by Carol Long

This project is composed of three documents: **index.html**, **script.js**,
and **style.css**.

In **index.html**, the structure of the website is built.
In **style.css**, the style of the website is defined.
In **script.js**, the interactive action is defined.

This project is called *Build your city of stars*, and it has the same function as
the example. The only difference is that instead of squares, it draws stars.
