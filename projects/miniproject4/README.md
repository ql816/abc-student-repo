# FONT LOTTERY

## description
In this project, it seems that you can select a font from the Chrome Extension. Upon you clicking on the "GO!" button in the Chrome Extension, the program will run automatically to choose a random font for 40 times. It will also change the font size. Finally, the website will stop changing and a font lottery is drawn.
