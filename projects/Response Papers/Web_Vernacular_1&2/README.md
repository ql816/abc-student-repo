# Response to Web Vernacular 1 & 2
## by Carol Long

It is fascinating to see how the web developed throughout all these years. I still remember when I was a kid in around 2006, the website design was pretty simple. Websites (in China) were made up of simple dots and lines with some colors. The colors were usually with high saturation. Below is the homepage of early Taobao.

Talking back to the readings, “A Vernacular Web” was published in 2005, and “A Vernacular Web 2” was published in 2007. Both of them have a history of more than ten years. Trends in these two passages seem a little out of date now. The style favored by website creators has changed dramatically. I feel like people nowadays prefer simple and straightforward websites with low saturation. People start to favor glittering stuff less than what was stated in “A Vernacular Web 2”. After getting used to the website designs nowadays, the websites from the past seem like vintages. It makes me curious about what the websites will become in the future. Will it be fancier or even simpler? Only time can tell.
Another topic in the readings that triggers my memory is the homepages and myspace. I was so little when homepages were trends, but I did involve when myspace was popular. At that time, most Chinese kids use QQ Zone as myspace. This QQ Zone has every function of myspace, including glittering decoration and background. (Below is an example of QQ Zone)

 We were so into it and when we even spend money on it to buy unique decoration. Nowadays, people are in favor of Twitter and Facebook more than myspace. At Twitter or Facebook, people usually only check the content rather than the design.
