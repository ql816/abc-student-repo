The Internet has undoubtedly made the world a smaller space, where everyone can connect. I remember when the first COVID-19 case was found in NYC, I joked with my best friend, saying that "we might have to be online friends for the left part of the semester." I did not expect it to happen for real, but the pandemic made it the reality. After returning to China in March, we stayed in our hometowns until Fall 2020 started. My friends and I were online friends for a half year. This kind of online relationship is very different from a face-to-face relationship. Through mobile apps, we can chat with each other very frequently, and we can talk about anything we want; the connection and conversation are text-based. In apps, there is usually a lot of emojis or meme to expand the conversation's meaning more vividly. However, I feel that none of these can replace face-to-face communication. It is true that with text-based communication, we communicate faster than ever, and the content in one conversation is very dense. We are switching so constantly between chats with different people. It looks that our lives are fulfilled and enjoyable. However, the unique time we share with a specific person is lost. As is stated in the reading, the online relationship makes us busier. However, it may be imperative to share some leisure time with others face-to-face.
